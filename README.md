‚¨áÔ∏è Download & Installation
BeaconBible is distributed via GitHub Releases on our dedicated releases repository. We do not distribute the source code with the compiled applications.
To get started, simply visit our releases page and download the appropriate package for your operating system.
ü™ü Windows (x64)
1.	Go to the BeaconBible Releases page.
2.	Download the latest BeaconBible-win_x64.zip file.
3.	Extract the contents of the zip file to a folder of your choice (e.g., C:\Program Files\BeaconBible).
4.	Locate BeaconBible-win_x64.exe inside the extracted folder and double-click to run the application.
Important Windows Prerequisites:
‚Ä¢	Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime: Most modern Windows 10/11 systems have this installed. If not, the application might prompt you to install it, or you can download it directly from Microsoft's website.
‚Ä¢	Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (x64): Required for many Windows applications. If you encounter errors about missing DLLs (e.g., VCRUNTIME140.dll), download and install the latest x64 redistributable from Microsoft's website.
üêß Linux (AppImage)
1.	Go to the BeaconBible Releases page.
2.	Download the latest BeaconBible-x.y.z.AppImage file. (Replace x.y.z with the actual version number).
3.	Make the AppImage executable: Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the file, and run:
4.	chmod +x BeaconBible-x.y.z.AppImage

5.	Run the application:
6.	./BeaconBible-x.y.z.AppImage

Important Linux Prerequisites/Notes:
‚Ä¢	FUSE: AppImages require FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) to run. Most modern Linux distributions have this pre-installed.
‚Ä¢	WebKitGTK: The AppImage bundles most necessary libraries, but relies on your system's WebKitGTK (the webview component). If you encounter rendering issues, ensure your system has webkit2gtk installed (e.g., sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-37 on Debian/Ubuntu, or sudo dnf install webkit2gtk4 on Fedora).
üçè macOS (x64 / ARM64 Universal)
1.	Go to the BeaconBible Releases page.
2.	Download the latest BeaconBible-mac_universal.zip (for Intel and Apple Silicon Macs) or BeaconBible-mac_arm64.zip (for Apple Silicon only).
3.	Unzip the downloaded file.
4.	Drag the BeaconBible.app bundle into your Applications folder.
5.	Double-click BeaconBible.app to launch.
Note for macOS: macOS Gatekeeper might block the application from opening initially. If you see a "BeaconBible.app cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer" message, right-click (or Ctrl-click) the application, select "Open," and then confirm that you want to open it.
‚öôÔ∏è How to Run
After following the installation steps for your operating system, simply launch the executable:
‚Ä¢	Windows: Double-click BeaconBible-win_x64.exe
‚Ä¢	Linux: ./BeaconBible-x.y.z.AppImage from your terminal after making it executable.
‚Ä¢	macOS: Double-click BeaconBible.app in your Applications folder.
‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
‚Ä¢	"Permission denied" on Linux: Ensure you've made the .AppImage executable using chmod +x. If you're trying to run the direct BeaconBible-linux_x64 binary (not the AppImage) and get this error, ensure you're in a Linux filesystem (like WSL home directory, not mounted Windows drives) or configure WSL's /etc/wsl.conf with metadata option as described in WSL documentation.
‚Ä¢	Application does not launch (Windows): Verify that WebView2 Runtime and Visual C++ Redistributable are installed. Check your system's Event Viewer for application errors.
‚Ä¢	Blank window or rendering issues: Ensure your system's webview component is up-to-date. For Linux, this often means webkit2gtk.
‚Ä¢	Audio not playing: Check your system's audio settings and ensure volume is up for the application.
